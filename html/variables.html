    <h1>Variables</h1>


<p>In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.</p>

<p>
  x = 3
  x is the identifier
  3 is the value
</p>
  </div>


  <p>Global vs. Local Varibles</p>


  <p>In this example x is defined as a local variable. When a variable is local is exists only for the duration of the fucntion which it is defined</p>
  <code>var x = 3</code>

  <p>In this example x is defined as a global variable. When a variable is global for the duration of the entire program</p>

  <code>x = 3</code>
</div>
