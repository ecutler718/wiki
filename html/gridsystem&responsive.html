    <p>Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works:
      Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.<br>
      Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.<br>
      Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.<br>
      Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts. Less mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
     <p>
      Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows.<br>
      The negative margin is why the examples below are outdented. It's so that content within grid columns is lined up with non-grid content.<br>
      Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.<br>
      If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.<br>
      Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greater than or equal to the breakpoint sizes, and override grid classes targeted at smaller devices. Therefore, e.g. applying any .col-md-* class to an element will not only affect its styling on medium devices but also on large devices if a     .col-lg-* class is not present.
