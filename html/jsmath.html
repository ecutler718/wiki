    <h1>Javascript Arithmatic</h1>
    <p>Here at the > prompt, you can type JavaScript and see what it does. Try typing 1 + 2; and pressing Enter.<br>
    You should see something like:<br>
    > 1 + 2<br>
    3<br>
    JavaScript took your code - 1 + 2 - evaluated it, and returned the result - 3.<br>
    The semicolon at the end of the line tells JavaScript to run everything before it. You'd think JavaScript would know on its own, wouldn't you?<br><br>

    Now try these:<br>
    4 - 3;<br>
    5 * 6;<br>
    10 / 2;<br>
    9 / 2;<br>
    7 + 8 * 9;<br>
    (7 + 8) * 9;<br>
    Try dividing 0 by 0. The result, NaN, stands for not a number. In JavaScript, NaN is actually considered a type of number.<br>
    Try dividing any other number by 0. The result, Infinity, is also a number in JavaScript.<br></p>
